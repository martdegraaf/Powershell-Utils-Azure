# Powershell Script Utilities

## Introduction

It is mine first attempt writing Powershell Script. I don't know all the ins- and outs of Powershell, so that's why some code look weird, because I am still learning to code Powershell in the proper way. BTW mine background is C#.

I tried to avoid large PS scripts which I often see during mine work. And I tried to apply a bit of Object Oriented Programming, but it can be a lot better. I wasn't fully aware of the possiblilties of OO in Powershell when creating these script.

Enjoy and have fun with the Scripts.

Kind regards,
Sven Ansem
